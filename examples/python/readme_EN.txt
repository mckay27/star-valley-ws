This file is to help you use this Demo.
A brief description of the use of this project is here:

1. Basic information:
This routine has been verified on the Raspberry Pi 3B+;
This routine has been verified using the 2-CH RS485 HAT module. 
You can view the corresponding test routines in the examples\ of the project.

2. Pin connection:
Pin connections can be viewed in \lib\waveshare_2_CH_RS485_HAT\TSL2591.py and will be repeated here:
2-CH_RS485_HAT      =>    RPI(BCM)
VCC                 ->    3.3V/5V
GND                 ->    GND
SCLK                ->    21
MISO                ->    24
MOSI                ->    20
CS                  ->    18
IRQ                 ->    24

3.Add driver
    # In /boot/config.txt:
    sudo nano /boot/config.txt
    
    # Add the following, int_pin is set according to the actual welding mode:
    dtoverlay=sc16is752-spi1,int_pin=24

    # reboot device
    sudo reboot
    
    After reboot, the driver of SC16IS752 will be loaded into the system 
    kernel. At this time, you can run ls/dev to see that there will be more 
    devices as follows:
    ttySC0      ttySC1

4.Installation library
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python-pip
    sudo apt-get install python-pil
    sudo pip install RPi.GPIO
    sudo apt-get install python-serial
    sudo pip install serial
    sudo pip install pyserial

or
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    sudo apt-get install python3-pil
    sudo pip3 install RPi.GPIO
    sudo apt-get install python3-serial
    sudo pip3 install serial
    sudo pip3 install pyserial

5. Basic use:
Test the program in the examples\ directory:
The routine main.py ends the receive string for channel 1 with '\n' and then sends the received string.
The routine test.py sends data to each other on channel 1 and channel 2.
python2
    sudo python main.py

python3
    sudo python3 main.py
